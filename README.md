## Goal
The goal of this project is to port Spidermonkey's Baseline JIT Compilers to RISC-V ISA's RV64GC Platform. Adding additonal Spidermonkey support features for RISC-V architecture is desired.

## Roadmap
| Time    | Task Log |
| ------  | -------- |
| Week 0  | Pre - Tasks |
| Week 1  | Introduction and Induction |
| Week 2  | Understanding Mozilla Codebase and testing on x86 |
| Week 3  | Relating prev work with RISC-V |
| Week 4  | Cross compiling on RV64GC |
| Week 5  | Understanding JIT Code Structure |
| Week 6  | Establising Base JIT Code Skeleton for RISC-V  |
| Week 7  | Native Compile using QEMU on Linux Fedora |
| Week 8  | Native Compile Try on RISCV Unmatched Board |
| Week 9  | Working on RISCV architecture and baseline code files |
| Week 10 | Started Regression testing for RISCV |
| Week 11 | Finalising JIT Code and initiating patch |
| Week 12 | Finishing Documentation and post for review |

## Schedule
**Work Timeline:** September 2021 to November 2021
**Future Plans:** Contribute towards achieving all deliverables

## Conclusions
1. Cross compiling Spidermonkey on RV64GC induces many linking errors after generating the binaries.
2. Native compiling Spidermonkey on QEMU/TinyEMU emulator produces faster results than RISC-V Unmatched Hardware Board.
